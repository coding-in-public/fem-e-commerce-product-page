# Frontend Mentor - E-commerce product page solution

## Videos

I did a series of three livestreams to get the mobile version of the site mostly done. I put it up on Netlify, which you can view here: https://fem-product-page.netlify.app/

- [Video 2: Gallery and nav](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68szNZ3dogI)
- [Video 3: Cart, fixing nav and gallery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gIhsSF_4P8)

## What’s left to do
To call this “complete” I'd need to at least do the following:

- Finalize mobile details
  - get the fixed nav bar and mobile gallery to layout correctly. 
  - fix the slider buttons on safari mobile
  - get cart to update *only* when clicking **Add to Cart** (not sure what I was thinking there)
  - fix nav spacing on mobile safari
  - Ensure aria attributes are set correctly
  - Add appropriate meta tags in the head and json-ld

- Desktop (everything)

## What’s next?

I tend to have a Community Improvements branch on my larger projects. I'll be updating this with more finalized code as I have time, but you’re also welcome to contribute as well.

While I don’t plan on live streaming any more of the project, I’ll probably update the netlify site with my more finalized code (which you can also view in the Community Improvements branch).
